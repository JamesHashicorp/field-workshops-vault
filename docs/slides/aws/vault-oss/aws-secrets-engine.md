# Generating Dynamic Credentials for AWS with Vault
<br>
The AWS secrets engine generates AWS access credentials dynamically, based on IAM policies.

The AWS secrets engine makes working with AWS IAM much easier, since their is no clicking around
a web UI, and everything can be scripted/automated.

<br>
Additionally, the process is codified and mapped to internal auth methods (such as LDAP). The
AWS IAM credentials are time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault lease expires.

Vault supports three different types of credentials to retrieve from AWS: `iam_user`,
`assumed_role`, `federation_token`.

`iam_user`: Vault will create an IAM user for each lease, attach the managed IAM policies as
specified in the role to the user. Vault will then generate an access key and secret key for
the IAM user and return them to the caller.

`assumed_role`: Vault will call `sts:AssumeRole` and return the access key, secret key, and session
token to the caller.

`federation_token`: Vault will call `sts:GetFederationToken` passing in the supplied AWS policy
document and return the access key, secret key, and session token to the caller.

Most commonly, users leverate the `iam_user` Vault AWS secrets engine. For more information on the
`assumed_role` and `federation_token` secrets engines, review the
[STS Federation Tokens](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/index.html#sts-credentials)
 documentation.
