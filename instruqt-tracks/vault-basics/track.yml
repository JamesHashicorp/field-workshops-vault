  Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

  Vault tightly controls access to secrets by authenticating against trusted sources of identity such as Active Directory, LDAP, Kubernetes, CloudFoundry, and cloud platforms. Vault enables fine grained authorization of which users and applications are permitted access to secrets.

  We invite you to join the ranks of the Vault community today!

  This track will introduce you to Vault open source, starting with the Vault CLI.

    You can run the following commands in the terminal on the left.

    Check the version of Vault running on your machine:
    ```
    vault version
    ```

    You can always get help if you're curious about command syntax:
