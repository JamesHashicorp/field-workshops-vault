Dynamic Secrets: Protecting Databases
-------------------------
Let's review our lab diagram:
.center[![:scale 85%](images/workshop_lab_environment.png)]
Normally database credentials are long-lived and stored on the app server.

With dynamic credentials, we can make a request to Vault, then Vault will use a special account on the database server to create a brand new username and password. Vault manages the lifecycle and policy of these credentials.

???
The database secrets engine supports common database types including MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra and others. All of them work the same basic way:

1. Vault admin enables the database secrets engine
1. The database secrets engine is configued with the correct plugin and connection info. A service account with permissions to manage users on the database server is required.
1. A role is created in Vault that executes a SQL statement to create users with the correct permissions and access. You can also define the TTL or time to live for credentials. Multiple roles can be applied to the same secrets engine, for enabling different levels of access.
1. Applications and users can now authenticate and retrieve new database credentials as needed.
1. These 'disposable' credentials can be valid for an hour, a day, or a month. The TTL settings can be tuned to suit your needs.
1. In Case of Emergency: If you suspect credentials have been compromised you can revoke any or all of the outstanding dynamic credentials immediately.

Dynamic Secrets: Enable and Create Role
-------------------------
The commands for configuring the database secrets backend are long and somewhat complex. We've provided a bash script that you can run to make sure we don't have any typos. From your SSH terminal on the Vault server run the `database_setup.sh` script:

Command:
```bash
./database_setup.sh
```

Output:
```tex
Success! Enabled the database secrets engine at: lob_a/workshop/database/
Success! Data written to: lob_a/workshop/database/roles/workshop-app-long
Success! Data written to: lob_a/workshop/database/roles/workshop-app
Script complete.
```

Dynamic Secrets: Database
-------------------------
Let's take a closer look at what happened when we ran that script:
```bash
vault secrets enable -path=lob_a/workshop/database database

vault write lob_a/workshop/database/config/wsmysqldatabase \
    plugin_name=mysql-database-plugin \
    connection_url="{{username}}:{{password}}@tcp(${MYSQL_ENDPOINT})/" \
    allowed_roles="workshop-app","workshop-app-long" \
    username="hashicorp" \
    password="Password123!"

vault write lob_a/workshop/database/roles/workshop-app-long \
    db_name=wsmysqldatabase \
    creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';GRANT ALL ON my_app.* TO '{{name}}'@'%';" \
    default_ttl="1h" \
    max_ttl="24h"

vault write lob_a/workshop/database/roles/workshop-app \
    db_name=wsmysqldatabase \
    creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';GRANT ALL ON my_app.* TO '{{name}}'@'%';" \
    default_ttl="5m" \
    max_ttl="1h"
```

???
We specified a number of things:
* The path someone would call: "lob_a/workshop/database"
* The name of the database the role can interact with: wsmysqldatabase
* The creation statement that defines the capabilities of the user that is created
* The default time to live.  One role specified an hour, and the other 5 minutes
* The maximum duration for a generated account; 24 hours and 1 hour respectively

Exercise 1:<br>
Use the vault command line tool to retreive database credentials from the `lob_a/workshop/database/creds/workshop-app` endpoint.

Exercise 2:<br>
Use a curl command to retreive database credentials from the `lob_a/workshop/database/creds/workshop-app-long` endpoint.

**Hint:** You can look at your previous commands with the `history` command.

.center[.lab-header[üë©‚Äçüî¨ Lab Exercise 7a: Answers]]
<br><br>
Exercise #1<br>
Authenticated users with read access can run the following command to get new credentials:

```bash
vault read lob_a/workshop/database/creds/workshop-app
```

Exercise #2<br>
Pass a valid token along with your curl command and you can do the same thing through the API:

```bash
curl --header 'X-Vault-Token: root' \
http://localhost:8200/v1/lob_a/workshop/database/creds/workshop-app-long
```

Dynamic Secrets: verify account
-------------------------
Use your newly created credentials to log onto the MySQL database. We've created a handy helper script to make this easier. The script will fetch new credentials from Vault and then use them to log onto the database server, then run a `show databases;` command and exit.

Command:
```bash
./mysql_login.sh
```

Output:
```tex
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

Vault Transit - Encryption as a Service
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/vault-eaas.webp)]

* Vault has an encryption-as-a-service secrets engine called **transit**.
* The transit engine is API-driven encryption
* Centralized key management
* Ensure only approved ciphers and algorithms are used
* Developers never have to worry about managing keys
* Supports automated key rotation and re-wrapping

???
This is encryption that is secure, accessible and relatively easy to implement. Instead of forcing developers to learn cryptography, we present them with a familiar API that can be used to encrypt, decrypt, or both.

Vault Transit - Example Application
-------------------------
In the next lab we'll set up a demo application that uses Vault transit to encrypt and decrypt data. Our app will store its data in the MySQL database we created earlier.  

From your Vault server SSH session run the following command:

Command:
```bash
./transit_setup.sh
```

The script may take a few minutes to complete while it downloads and configures our application.

---
name: Vault-Transit-Engine-2
Vault Transit - Start the Application
-------------------------
First we'll start up the demo application without Vault enabled. Run the following commands to start your app:

Commands:
```bash
cd ~/transit-app-example/backend/
python3 app.py
```

Output:
```tex
In Main...
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off

```

This is a Python Flask application. The app listens on port 5000 for traffic.

---

Vault Transit - Open the App
-------------------------
Open a browser tab and navigate to the address of your Vault server on port 5000.

name: Vault-Transit-Engine-4
Vault Transit - Application Views
-------------------------
<br><br>
There are two main sections in the application.
1. **Records View**
  * The records view displays records in plain text.
  * This view represents what a logged in user or authenticated application might be able to see.

1. **Database View**
  * This view shows the raw records in the database.
  * It is the equivalent of the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

Vault Transit - Records View
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/records_view.png)]

As we would expect an authorized user is able to see some of the sensitive data.

Vault Transit - Add a Record
-------------------------
Click the "Add Record" button and enter some data. Don't use your real social security number here.

.center[![:scale 80%](images/add_user.png)]

---
name: Vault-Transit-Engine-7
Vault Transit - View the Record
-------------------------
<br><br><br>
Click on **Records** at the top of the page. Notice your new record at the bottom of the list.

Next click on **Database View**. You should see the exact same data. This means that PII (Personally Identifiable Data) is being stored in plain text in our database records.

How can we improve this? Let's enable Vault Transit and see.

Vault Transit - Enable EaaS
-------------------------
Return to your shell and stop the application with the **CTRL-C** command.

Next you'll need to make one change to your config.ini file. You may use **nano** or **vi** to edit the file. The line you need to edit is highlighted below. Change where it says `Enabled = False` to `Enabled = True`:

Command:
```bash
nano config.ini
```

Line to change:
```bash
...
[VAULT]
*Enabled = True
DynamicDBCreds = False
ProtectRecords=False
...
```

Save and exit the file. `CTRL-x` in Nano, `:wq` in vim.

name: Vault-Transit-Engine-8
Vault Transit - Enable EaaS
-------------------------
After you have enabled Vault, start the application back up:

Commands:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

Output:
```tex

<br><br>
**Exercise 1:**<br>
Enter some more fake employee data into the application.

Browse to the records view. What do you see?

Now browse to the database view? What's different now?

**Exercise 2:**<br>
Go into the Vault UI and click on **lob_a/workshop/transit** from the **Secrets** page.<br>
Click on **customer-key**, then click on **versions**.<br>
Click on the **Rotate encryption key** button at the bottom.

Now go back to the app and add another record. What do you see in the database view?

???
NOTE: There's a known bug in the UI that causes all the dates to be Jan. 1970. These are correct if you query the API.

.center[![:scale 100%](images/fred_flintstone.png)]

**Exercise 1:**<br>
When you enabled Vault each new record entered into the database has it's PII send through Vault *before* being written to the database. This greatly reduces the risk of sensitive data being compromised.

Even if an attacker manages to get access to the database they will only be able to see ciphertext (which is useless without the decryption keys that are safely stored in Vault.)

**Exercise 2:**<br>
Even when we rotate the encryption key, the app is unaware of any changes. Once the key is rotated all new records will be encrypted with the new key. Old records can still be decrypted because Vault is using a keyring. If you feel that somehow one of the old keys was compromised you can force all new encryption or decryption to be done with a newer version of the key. Data can also be re-encrypted using the rewrap function.
