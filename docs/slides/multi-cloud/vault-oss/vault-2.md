# Interacting With Vault

Vault provides several mechanisms for interacting with it:
* The Vault [CLI](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/index.html)
* The Vault [API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/overview)
* The Vault [UI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/ui)

In this chapter, we explore the CLI and the UI.<br>
We will explore the API later.

???

* Chapter 2 focuses on interacting with Vault
* We will explore the Vault CLI and UI in this chapter

# Some Basic Vault CLI Commands
* `vault` by itself will give you a list of many Vault CLI commands.
  * The list starts with the most common ones.
* `vault version` tells you the version of Vault you are running.
* `vault read` is used to read secrets from Vault.
* `vault write` is used to write secrets to Vault.

The `-h`, `-help`, and `--help` flags can be added to get help for any Vault CLI command.

???
Let's discuss some of the basic Vault CLI commands.

# Vault Server Modes
Vault servers can be run in two different modes:
* "Dev" mode that is only intended for development
* "Prod" mode that can be used in QA and production

???
* Discuss Vault's two server modes

---
name: vault-dev-server
# Vault's "Dev" Mode
* It is not secure.
* It stores everything in memory.
* Vault is automatically unsealed.
* The root token can be specified before launching.

**Please never store actual secrets on a server run in "Dev" mode.**

???
* Discuss limitations of Vault's "Dev" mode.
* Warn students to never store real secrets on a Dev server.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Lab Challenge 2.2: Run a Vault "Dev" Server
* In this lab, you'll run your first Vault server in "Dev" mode.
* You'll also write your first secret to Vault and use the UI.
* Instructions:
  * Click the "Your First Secret" challenge of the "Vault Basics" track.
  * Then click the green "Start" button.
  * Follow the challenge's instructions.
  * Click the green "Check" button when finished.

name: Vault-UI
# The Vault UI
* In order to use the Vault UI, you must sign in.
* Vault supports multiple authentication methods.
* A new Vault server will only have the Token auth method enabled.
* In the challenge you just completed, you used the Token auth method and specified "root" as the token.

???

* Let's talk about the Vault UI a bit, including ways of signing into it.
* While you used the token "root" in the last challenge, you'll be running a Vault server in "Prod"  mode in the rest of the track and will have to use the token generated when you initialize that server in the next challenge.
